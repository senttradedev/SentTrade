# SentTrade - AI-Powered DeFi Sentiment Trading Platform

SentTrade is a cutting-edge DeFi trading platform that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze social media sentiment and execute optimized trading strategies on Sonic's high-performance blockchain with lightning-fast speed.

## Overview

SentTrade bridges the gap between social sentiment and DeFi trading by continuously monitoring and analy zing conversations across Twitter and other platforms to identify market trends and trading opportunities. The platform transforms this sentiment data into actionable trading signals that are executed through a suite of smart contracts deployed on the Sonic blockchain.

## Why Sonic Blockchain?

Sonic is the ideal foundation for SentTrade due to its:

- **Ultra-low transaction fees** (less than $0.001 per transaction)
- **Lightning-fast finality** (under 2 seconds)
- **EVM compatibility** for seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols
- **High throughput** capable of handling 2,000+ TPS
- **Robust DeFi ecosystem** including SonicSwap DEX, lending protocols, and more
- **Cross-chain interoperability** via deBridge integration

SentTrade leverages Sonic's performance advantages to execute trades with minimal slippage and maximum efficiency, even during periods of high market volatility.

## ZerePy AI Framework

At the core of SentTrade's sentiment analysis is ZerePy, an advanced Python framework for deploying AI agents:

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Integrates with OpenAI, Claude, and other leading language models
- **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directing AI agents that monitor social platforms 24/7
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced sentiment analysis with context understanding
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves analysis accuracy based on market outcomes
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extensible for additional data sources and analysis methods
- **Twitter API Integration**: Real-time monitoring of crypto conversations and influencers

ZerePy agents not only analyze sentiment but can also interact with users, explain trading decisions, and provide market insights through natural language interfaces.

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform uses four main smart contracts working in harmony:

1. **StrategyManager**: The brain of the system that:

   - Stores and manages trading strategies with customizable parameters
   - Processes incoming sentiment signals and validates them against strategy rules
   - Tracks performance metrics for each strategy
   - Manages user subscriptions and permissions
   - Coordinates execution across other contracts

2. **TradingExecutor**: The execution arm that:

   - Interfaces directly with SonicSwap and other DEXes
   - Optimizes trade routing for best execution price
   - Implements slippage protection mechanisms
   - Handles token approvals and swap operations
   - Provides real-time price feeds to the strategy manager

3. **BridgeExecutor**: The cross-chain facilitator that:

   - Connects with deBridge protocol for cross-chain operations
   - Manages gas fees across different networks
   - Ensures transaction finality across chains
   - Handles cross-chain error recovery
   - Optimizes for cross-chain efficiency

4. **MetricsAggregator**: The analytics engine that:
   - Collects on-chain market data like liquidity and volume
   - Calculates volatility and other technical indicators
   - Provides historical performance data
   - Generates on-chain analytics for strategy refinement
   - Feeds data back to the AI system for continuous improvement

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Hardhat for smart contract development
- Poetry for Python dependency management
- Sonic wallet with testnet tokens (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/senttrade.git
   cd senttrade
   ```

2. Install JavaScript dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```
   cd backend
   poetry install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration.

### Development

Start the frontend development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Run the backend AI agent:

```
cd backend
poetry run python main.py
```

### Deployment

Deploy smart contracts to Sonic Chain:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sonic
```

Build and deploy the frontend:

```
npm run build
npm run start

## Technical Architecture

The platform consists of three main components working in harmony:

1. **Frontend Dashboard**: Next.js application providing:

   - Real-time sentiment visualization
   - Strategy management interface
   - Performance analytics
   - User authentication and preferences
   - Responsive design for all devices

2. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts on Sonic blockchain handling:

   - Strategy execution logic
   - On-chain trading operations
   - Cross-chain bridging
   - Performance tracking
   - Security and access control

3. **AI Backend**: Python-based ZerePy framework powering:
   - Social media data collection
   - Natural language processing
   - Sentiment scoring algorithms
   - Signal generation
   - Machine learning improvements

### Sentiment Analysis Flow

1. ZerePy agents continuously monitor Twitter and other platforms for cryptocurrency discussions
2. Natural language processing analyzes text for sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Context-aware algorithms filter out noise and identify meaningful signals
4. Sentiment scores are aggregated, weighted by influence and relevance
5. Time-series analysis identifies significant sentiment shifts
6. Trading signals are generated when sentiment crosses predefined thresholds
7. Signals are transmitted to smart contracts for execution

### Trading Execution Flow

1. StrategyManager receives sentiment signals from the AI backend
2. Signals are validated against strategy parameters and risk controls
3. If validated, TradingExecutor calculates optimal trade size and timing
4. TradingExecutor performs swaps on SonicSwap DEX with slippage protection
5. For cross-chain strategies, BridgeExecutor handles asset transfers via deBridge
6. MetricsAggregator updates performance metrics and feeds data back to the AI
7. Users receive notifications of completed trades and performance updates

## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts undergo rigorous security audits
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Slippage protection to prevent front-running
- Circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
- Private keys never stored in the application
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

## Future Roadmap

- **Q1 2025**: Integration with additional social media platforms and news sources
- **Q2 2025**: Advanced machine learning models for improved sentiment prediction
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile application for on-the-go monitoring and trading
- **Q4 2025**: DAO governance for community-driven strategy development
- **Q1 2026**: Integration with additional DEXes and blockchains
- **Q2 2026**: Institutional-grade API for professional traders
